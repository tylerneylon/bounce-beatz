# pong-love

This is the classic game pong, recreated
in Lua using the Love game engine.

Why? Because it's fun to make :)

This is essentially the simplest video game I can think of.

If I have time after this, I may remake more classic games.
I'm also considering making a game-making tutorial based
on a simple game like this, since the code is small and
relatively easy to learn from.
