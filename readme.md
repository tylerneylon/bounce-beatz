# bounce-beatz

This is a table-tennis-inspired game built in Lua
using the Löve game engine. (Did you know that "ping pong" is trademarked?? It is.)

Why does this exist? Because it's fun to make :)

If you have Löve installed, you can play by typing:

    $ love src

from the bounce-beatz directory.

This started as essentially the simplest video game I could think of.

It's evolving to be something more interesting over time.
